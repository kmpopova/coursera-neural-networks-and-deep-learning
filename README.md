# Coursera: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This folder contains course materials, programming assignments and their solutions for the DeepLearning.AI course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera (part of  Deep Learning Specialization). 

It is organized by week (skipping Week 1 as it contained no assignment) and includes Jupyter notebooks, datasets, images, testing and utility scripts for hands-on learning and programming assignments.

  - `W2A2/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb`: Assignment 2, Logistic regression assignment with a neural network perspective.
  - `datasets/`, `images/`: Supporting files and images for assignments.
- **Week3**: Building a shallow neural network from scratch.
  - `Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer.ipynb`: Planar data classification with a one-hidden-layer neural network.
  - `images/`: Images for the assignment notebook.
- **Week4**: Deep neural networks and applications.
  - `W4A1/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb`: Assignment 1, Step-by-step implementation of a deep neural network.
  - `Deep Neural Network - Application.ipynb`: Assignment 2, Applying a deep neural network to image classification.
  - `datasets/`, `images/`: Additional resources and datasets.


## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code, or Google Colab) to follow along with the lessons. Supporting files and datasets are organized in subfolders for each week.

## Purpose

This folder is intended for educational use as part of the DeepLearning.AI specialization, providing hands-on experience with neural networks, vectorization, and deep learning concepts in Python.
